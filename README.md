# DungeonExplorers

Welcome to Dungeon Explorers, a game that I’ve been working on. It’s a thrilling adventure set in a dark, atmospheric world where you battle enemies, solve puzzles, and uncover secrets. The game features a 2D art style, detailed environments, and a suspenseful soundtrack that all come together to create an engaging experience.

What’s the Game About?
In Dungeon Explorers, you’re on a quest to defeat enemies and find your way through each level. You'll need to locate and destroy specific statues to progress to the next level. The gameplay loop is designed to be challenging yet rewarding, with endless replayability to keep you coming back for more.

How Did It Come Together?
Originally, this project was a team effort, but due to unforeseen circumstances, I ended up taking it on solo. I’ve put a lot of work into refining the gameplay, fixing bugs, and adding features to make it as fun and polished as possible.

Key Features
Challenging Gameplay: Fight enemies, solve puzzles, and navigate through fixed levels.
Visuals: A captivating 2D art style with detailed environments.
Soundtrack: Suspenseful music that enhances the atmosphere.
Fixed-Level Design: Instead of procedural generation, the game now features two fixed levels for a more structured experience.

In the build folder, it contains a WEBGL build of the game in case the coursera shareable link did not work.
